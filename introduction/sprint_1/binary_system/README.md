Timofey wrote down two numbers in binary notation and asked Gosha to output their sum, also in binary. The possibility of adding binary numbers built into the programming language cannot be used. Help Gosha to solve the problem.
The solution should work for O(N), where N is the number of digits of the maximum number on the input.
