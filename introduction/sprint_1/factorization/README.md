The basic theorem of arithmetic says: any number is decomposed into the product of prime multipliers in a unique way, with the precision of their permutations. For example:
The number 8 can be represented as 2 × 2 × 2.
The number 50 -- as 2 × 5 × 5 (or 5 × 5 × 2, or 5 × 2 × 5). The three options differ only in the order of the multipliers.
Decomposing a number into prime multipliers is called factorizing the number.
Write a program that factorizes a given number.
