Vasya asked Alla to help him solve a problem. This time in computer science.
For a non-negative integer X, the list form is an array of its digits from left to right. For example, for 1231 the list form will be [1,2,3,1]. The input is the number of digits of the number X, the list form of the non-negative number X, and the non-negative number K. The number K does not exceed 10000. The length of the number X does not exceed 1000.
You need to return the list form of the number X + K.
Do not use the built-in tools of the language to add long numbers.
