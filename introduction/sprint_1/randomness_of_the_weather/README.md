The meteorological service of your city has decided to investigate the weather in a new way.
By air temperature on a particular day we will understand the maximum temperature on that day.
By the randomness of weather for n days, the service understands the number of days in which the temperature is strictly higher than on the day before (if such a day exists) and on the day after the current day (if such a day exists). For example, if for 5 days the maximum air temperature was [1, 2, 5, 4, 8] degrees, then the randomness for this period is 2: on the 3rd and 5th days the described conditions were fulfilled.
Determine from the daily temperature readings the randomness of the weather for this period.Note that if the number of readings n=1, the only day will be chaotic.
