Vasya is doing a math test: calculating the value of functions at different points. The weather is fine and his friends are calling him to go for a walk. But the boy decides to finish the test first and only then go to his friends. Unfortunately, Vasya doesn't know how to program yet. But you can. Help Vasya write the code of the function that calculates y = ax2 + bx + c. Write a program that will output the value of the function at the point x by the coefficients a, b, c and the number x.
