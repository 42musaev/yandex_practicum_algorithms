Note the constraints in this problem.
Rita and Gosha are playing a game. Rita has n chips, each of which has a number of points written on it. The chips lie on the table in the order of non-decreasing number of points on them. First Gosha names the number k, then Rita has to choose two chips, the sum of points on which is equal to the given number.
Rita is tired of looking for chips by herself, and she decided to use her programming skills to solve this problem. Help her write a program to find the right chips.
