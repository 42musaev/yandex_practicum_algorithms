Vasya decided to confuse his mom -- do things in reverse order. His to-do list is now stored in a doubly-linked list. Write a function that will return the list in reverse order.
Note: you don't need to read the input data in this problem. You only need to write a function that takes the head of a doubly-linked list as input and returns the head of an inverted list.
